My online video-to-audio conversion tool

Note: This tool is under basic development and is not working yet. If you'd like to try out a tool like this, though, my [Ruby CLI](https://github.com/codeconscious/youtube-audio-downloader-ruby) and [C# UI](https://github.com/codeconscious/youtube-audio-downloader) versions are both available and working. (This has become my go-to project to pick up new languages, it seems...)

## Summary

A small Rust CLI tool that acts as a wrapper around [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/) to even more easily download audio from specified YouTube (and later, other services') videos. I created this tool to get better acquainted with Rust and will development and improve it much more as I learn more. (Thus far, Rust is quite fascinating.)

(More details to come later...)
